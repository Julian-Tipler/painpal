run "npx expo start" to start the project

Plan:
**Backend**
* Set up simple backend with firebase functions to handle API calls. This API will use AWS?

**Frontend**
* Hosted with expo hosting
* Set up Appolo client frontend (works with React native!)
* Set up basic structure but don't style elements yet. Just set up basic positioning


Decide what server hosting platform, helper libraries, and database to use. Apollo is one of them.
Figure out how hosting is going to work. Where do I host the frontend and backend of my app?
Hello world database with /graphql endpoint
Hello world database with frontend app (Website skeleton is near complete!)
Set up Apollo client frontend (works with React native!)
Hello world 
Set up basic structure but don't style elements yet. Just set up basic positioning.
