"npx expo start"
**Frontend**
* Hosted with expo hosting (deploys to app store (testflight first) and play store)
* Apollo client frontend (works with React native!)
* Set up basic structure but don't style elements yet. Just set up basic positioning with text

"npm run dev"
**Backend**
* Apollo server
* Apollo's built in express server
* Mongoose
* MongoDB

**Todo**
- Decide what server hosting platform, helper libraries, and database to use.
  - Apollo server
    - using startStandaloneServer which uses express
  - Atlas MongoDB
    - With a library?
- Figure out how hosting is going to work. Where do I host the frontend and backend of my app?
  - frontend: Static hosting site? firebase??
  - server: AWS??
  - DB: Atlas
- Hello world database with /graphql endpoint
- Hello world database with frontend app (Website skeleton is near complete!)
- Set up Apollo client frontend (works with React native!)
- Hello world
- Set up basic structure but don't style elements yet. Just set up basic positioning.
